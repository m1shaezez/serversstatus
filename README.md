# Servers status
 Server Status is the latest, fast, server checker. When using it, you should not close it, because it hardly eats up your computer's memory. And most importantly, it is the first of a kind computer software where you can quickly, quickly, and quickly check the status of the servers of your favorite services. In a future release from BETA, it will have a new design, quick checks. This program provides support for your favorite operating systems. For example: Windows XP or Windows Vista (SP2 With Platform Update). This program is developed by PHP and C ++ codes. More services will be added soon, such as Epic Games, Epic Games Store and more.
